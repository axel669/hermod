# Hermod
Experimental twitch bot that runs in a browser.

## Motivation
Wanted a bot that could be run on the phone, save settings in the cloud,
and allow imprting custom scripts for awesome commands.

## Alpha Notes
- Does not work in Firefox (because they are stupid and don't support dynamic
    import in WebWorkers yet)
- Timer triggers do not work yet

## Planned Features
- Timer triggers
- Stream even triggers (follows, subs, bits, etc)
- User chat triggers (first time chat, saying specific phrases)
- Chat message triggers (respond to chat phrases instead of specific commands)
